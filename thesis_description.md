# Long Range Wide Area Network Research Network #

### Background ###
In 2018 Lübeck rolled out productive a LoRaWAN in the city. The infrastructure consists of 5 LoRaWAN gateways to cover Lübeck. For the scientific purpose, a second LoRaWAN network is needed in the city. Therefore, the aim is to set up independent LoRaWAN gateways, network and applications server architecture for this purpose.

### Details ###
First, research for open source solutions to set up a LoRaWAN gateway, network and an application server is required. Depending on the use case constraints, the best option is chosen. Second, the infrastructure and find suitable evaluation metrics like QoS, Network join time and round trip time for the research LoRaWAN is set up. Finally, fully, well-written documentation of your complete work is provided.

### Tasks

- Research on open source software solutions for LoRaWAN
- Set up a LoRaWAN gateway (open source)
- Set up a LoRaWAN networkserver (open source)
- Set up a LoRaWAN applicationserver (open source)
- Find metrics to evaluate LoRaWAN e.g. QoS, Network join time, round trip time
- Evaluate the research LoRaWAN based on 5 example applications
- Document how to set up a LoRaWAN gateway, network and application server

### Deliverables ###
- Detailed Overview of LoRaWAN (Milestone 1)
- 5 Examples of Applications for LoRaWAN with detailed description of their requirements  e.g. low power consumption, packets per day, QoS requirements (Milestone 1)
- Overview and discussion of the LoRaWAN gateway, network and application architecture and its limitation (Milestone 2)
- Fully Implemented and Tested LoRaWAN gateway, network and application server (Milestone 3)
- Fully Implemented and Tested LoRaWAN  Research Network with 3 LoRaWAN nodes. (Milestone 4)
- Evaluation of the network according to the requirements; especially packet delivery ratio (Milestone 5)
- Documentation how to setup a LoRaWAN Gateway, Networkserver and Applicationserver incl. Final Thesis document (Milestone 6)

### Requirements ###
- Experience in Linux are required
- Programming skills in C/Arduino are required
- Experience with microcontrollers and radio chips are beneficial
- Knowledge in wireless sensor networks is beneficial e.g. via wireless senornetworks in automation
- Knowledge in Matlab, Octave or Python are beneficial for evaluation
- Good self-organized working skills
- Engagement
